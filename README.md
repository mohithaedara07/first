Hi, my name is Mohitha Edara and I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Information Systems from Northeastern University.
This is my first Github repo, and I did had few hurdles in setting up and completing the assignment but could finally complete it in the given timeline.
I'm excited to learn and explore all the new things and concepts that would come up my way.
